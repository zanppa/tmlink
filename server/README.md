# TMLink server
This is a prototype implmentation of the TMLink server.

I've tested this on Raspberry PI Zero W. Some things are written 
with python3 while some others still require python 2.7...

## Preparations
First, you need to enable the gadget mode on the PI. Add `dtoverlay=dwc2` to `/boot/config.txt`.

You may need to compile a custom kernel to use the NCM gadget. If you do not wish to do that, 
you can also change things to use the RNDIS gadget.

Install and configure a DHCP server. See `configs/dhcp/` for more info.

Optional: Install and configure http server if you want to serve icons (which may be supported by 
some UPnP implementations, I don't use those yet). See `configs/http/` for more info.

## Running
First you need to configure the ethernet gadget: `sudo sh create_gadget.shÂ´.

If you want to use the RTP server for audio playback, you need to create the ALSA loopback device: 
`sudo sh create_snd_loopback.sh`.

Then, you can just launch the servers: `sh launch_servers.sh`. The ApplicationServer goes to background 
and the UPnP server stays on foreground.

Now this should work with the client after plugging the gadget in.

## Stopping
The UPnP server can be stopped by pressing `CTRL+D` or writing `stop` to the prompt. The ApplicationServer 
must be killed separately with `kill`.
